# DBMS-Project-GroceryApp


### Applications and the need of the Project:

Social‐distancing restrictions and health‐ and economy‐driven demand shifts from COVID‐19 has caused many small businesses to shut down, or to undergone loss. The reason for this is that, every individual household mostly prefers to buy their daily products and groceries via the online web sites like amazon, flip cart, Chitki etc, thus reducing the sales for the small local shop owners. This is what promoted us to build a web application, that takes the shop owners who are confined to their physical shops, to the online platform, where they can sell products, and make the same set of transactions, as they do in the shops, but online. Since this platform is online, the market for the shop owners can be also increased several times. Apart from this, one of the major driving reason why we chose this project, is the middleman obstacle that stands in the way of increasing the market of every Indian farmer. So, along with the shop owners, we have also included a separate section where all the farmers can upload their products and sell them to the online users.


### Features of the Web Application:

1. There are four roles in this application, namely: User, Farmer, Shop Owner and Delivery Partner.
2. User can search for the products either category wise or by the name of the products. The desired products can be added to the cart and the user can then checkout.
3. Farmer and Shop Owner can upload, save, update and delete the products which he/she wishes to sell via this web application.
4. Delivery Partner receives a notification regarding the source and destination of the order. He/She is responsible for the delivery of the placed order.
