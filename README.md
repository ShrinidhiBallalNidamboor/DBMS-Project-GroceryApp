# DBMS-Project-GroceryApp


### Applications and the need of the Project:

Social‐distancing restrictions and health‐ and economy‐driven demand shifts from COVID‐19 has caused many small businesses to shut down, or to undergone loss. The reason for this is that, every individual household mostly prefers to buy their daily products and groceries via the online web sites like amazon, flip cart, Chitki etc, thus reducing the sales for the small local shop owners. This is what promoted us to build a web application, that takes the shop owners who are confined to their physical shops, to the online platform, where they can sell products, and make the same set of transactions, as they do in the shops, but online. Since this platform is online, the market for the shop owners can be also increased several times. Apart from this, one of the major driving reason why we chose this project, is the middleman obstacle that stands in the way of increasing the market of every Indian farmer. So, along with the shop owners, we have also included a separate section where all the farmers can upload their products and sell them to the online users.


### Basis Features:

The features available depends on the role of the person using the application. This web application creates a template for the shop keepers and the farmers to sell their products online. There are mainly five roles in this application – a) Admin, b) User, c) Farmer, d) Shop Owner e) Delivery Partner. A person using this application can login as anyone of these five roles.
a) Admin: The gets to view total sales, and the sales of each individual seller. He/she also gets the privilege to view the order history of the users.
b) User: This user will be given the features to buy the groceries or the agricultural products and also make payments online. The orders will be delivered to the doorstep by the delivery partner to whom the request would be sent online. The user can search for the products either category wise or by the name of the products, and add the desired products onto the cart and later checkout.
c) Farmer: This user of the application can upload, save, update and delete the agricultural products that he/she wants to sell. As soon as the User makes an order for an agricultural product the corresponding farmer receives the order, through the application and then he/she has to approve the order.
d) Shop Owner: This user of the application can upload, save, update and delete the grocery items that the person sells in his/her shop. As soon as the User makes an order the corresponding Shop Owner who is selling the products in the order receives the notification, through the application and then he/she has to approve the order.
e) Delivery Partner: The delivery partner receives the notifications regarding the source and the destinations of the given orders. When the delivery is made the deliver partner has to update the status of the order as delivered.
